# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis

We have some data. We do some stats. We get some information about the parameters and distributions of the random variable which generates the data. Once we know that, we can answer questions and optimize processes. That is statistics.

In this course, we look at the link from data to statistics. We use two very basic math forms known as graphs and algebra. The graphs are a great way to figure out the distribution. Algebra helps us to calculate the mean, which is a statistic that is very good at estimating the parameters (this is where the algebra comes in). So, we use graphs for the distributions and algebra for the parameters. Once we know them, we can answer questions and optimize processes.

Statisticians got the idea of central limit theorem using graphs. It takes two hundred years to prove the central limit theorem using proper mathematics.
