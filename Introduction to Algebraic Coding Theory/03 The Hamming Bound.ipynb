    "Idea of Hamming Bound:\n",
    "- We have $|C|$ disjoint Hamming balls of radius $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{d-1}{2} \\right\\rfloor$\n",
    "- There can't be too many of them or they wouldn't all fit in $\\Sigma^n$\n",

    "**Definition.** The Hamming Ball in $\\Sigma^n$ of radius $e$ about $x \\in \\Sigma^n$ is\n",

    "\n",
    "The definition of volume of Hamming ball is unusual, because there is $x$ on the right-hand side and there is no $x$ on the left-hand side. This is okay, because the size of Hamming ball does not depend on $x$. We can also revise the definition above to the following:\n",

    "**Definition**. The volume of $B_{\\Sigma^n}(x,e)$ is\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Vol_{\\Sigma}(e,n) = |B_{\\Sigma^n}(0,e)|\n",

    "The volume of a Hamming ball is given by\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Vol_q(e,n) = 1 + \\begin{pmatrix} n \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} (q - 1) + \\begin{pmatrix} n \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} (q - 1)^2 + \\dots + \\begin{pmatrix} n \\\\ e \\end{pmatrix} (q - 1)^e\n",

    "\n",
    "Let $C \\subseteq \\Sigma^n$ be a code with distance $d$ and message length $k$. Let $q = |\\Sigma|$. Then,\n",

    "$$\n",
    "Such equation gives bound on the rate in terms of distance. The distance $d$ shows up on the right-hand side, whereas the rate is in the left-hand side. This is called the Hamming bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Back to Example 3\n",
    "\n",
    "In Example 3, message length $k = 4$, block length $n = 7$, distance $d = 3$, and the alphabet size $q = 2$.\n",

    "Vol_q \\left( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{d-1}{2}, n \\right\\rfloor \\right) = Vol_2(1,7) = 1 + \\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = 8\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Now, we write the Hamming bound\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{k}{n} \\leq 1 - \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{4}{7}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "In Example 3, $\\frac{k}{n} = \\frac{4}{7}$, so the Hamming bound is tight in this case. Namely, this code achieves the best possible trade off between rate and distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question to Ponder**. Can you come up with other codes where the Hamming bound is tight? Such codes would be provably optimal, at least in the trade off between rate and distance. In particular, can you generalize Example 3? Can you come up with completely different code?"
