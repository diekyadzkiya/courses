    "This is a code with message length $k = 4$, block length $n = 7$ over tha alphabet $\\{0,1\\}$ with the following encoding map $ENC(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4) = (x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_2+x_3+x_4,x_1+x_3+x_4,x_1+x_2+x_4)$. The message appears in the first four bits of the codewords and the last three bits of the codeword is the linear combination (modulo two) of the various message bits. The code $C$ is defined as the image of the encoding map $C = Im(ENC)$. This code can be visualized using circles. This is the Hamming Code of length 7.\n",

    "Any codeword $c \\in C$ satisfies the equation $Hc=0$. Equivalently, $C \\subseteq Ker(H)$. We claim that $C = Ker(H)$ by counting dimensions. First, $dim(Ker(H)) = 7 \\, (\\text{number of columns of } H) - 3 \\, (\\text{rank of } H) = 4$. The dimension of $C$ is also equal to 4, i.e. $dim(C) = 4$. Since the dimension of $C$ and $Ker(H)$ are equal, then $C = Ker(H)$. $H$ is a parity check matrix for $C$. Informally, a parity check matrix is just a matrix so that the code is equal to the kernel of that matrix. Parity check matrix can be really useful.\n",

    "- Use contradiction: say that there is a $c \\in C$ that has weight 1 or 2. That means there is a linear combination of one or two columns of $H$ that equals to 0 mod 2. Since any pair of columns of $H$ are linearly independent (no column is zero and anly linear combination of two columns is not zero, in mod 2 this means all elements must be the same), this can't happen. Therefore, for any code $c \\in C$, the weight $wt(c) \\geq 3$, hence the distance of $C$ is also greater than or equal to three.\n",
