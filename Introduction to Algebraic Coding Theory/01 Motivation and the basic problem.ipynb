    "### The Basic Problem in Coding Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "We have some message $x$ of length $k$. We are going to encode $x$ to get a codeword $c$ of length $n$, where $n > k$. We are adding some redundancy to the original data, because we expect something bad to happen. We obtain corrupted codeword $\\tilde c$. The goal in coding theory is defining the encoding map so that given the corrupted codeword $\\tilde c$, we can recover $x$. There are many applications of coding theory, for example communication and storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have some sender, called Alice. We have some receiver, called Bob. Alice would like to talk to Bob, but there is a noisy channel between them. Anything that Alice sends to Bob might get corrupted. In practice, Alice and Bob can be replaced by cell phone and cell tower. Alice has a message $x$ in $\\{0,1\\}^k$ that she wants to send to Bob. She is going to encode $x$ as a codeword $c \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$, which will be send across the channel. Bob receives the corrupted codeword $\\tilde c$. From this corrupted codeword, Bob figures out what Alice wanted to say. He is supposed to come up with $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a file $x \\in \\{0,1\\}^k$. We want to store the file on a storage medium, such as CD, Hard Drive or Raid Ray. Bad things can happen to the storage medium. We do not want to lose our data. So, we encode $x \\in \\{0,1\\}^k$ into a codeword $c \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$ by introducing some redundancy. The codeword $c$ is stored on the devices. After something bad happens, we are going to read the corrupted codeword $\\tilde c$. Ideally, we will able to recover the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Things We Care About\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Handling something bad\n",
    "1. Recovering info about $x$\n",
    "1. Minimizing overhead, namely maximize $k/n$\n",
    "1. Doing all of this efficiently, for example in the encoding and decoding process\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the best tradeoff between 1-4? If we minimize overhead, it would be harder to handle something bad or to recover info about $x$. We have not defined \"something bad\", \"info about $x$\" and \"efficiently\".\n",
